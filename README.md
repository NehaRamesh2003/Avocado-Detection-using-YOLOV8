## Introduction

The Avocado Detection Model aims to accurately detect avocados in images. This model is built using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework known for its speed and accuracy. The model can be used for applications such as automated quality control in agriculture, inventory management, and more.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/avocado-detection-yolov8.git
   cd avocado-detection-yolov8
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv yolov8-env
   source yolov8-env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `yolov8-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   pip install -U ultralytics
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of images of avocados with annotations. The dataset can be downloaded from [link to dataset source]. Ensure that the dataset is organized in the following structure:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── labels/
├── val/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── labels/
├── test/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── labels/
```

## Model Training

To train the model, use the following command within the `avocado_detection.ipynb` notebook:

```python
!python train.py --data data.yaml --cfg yolov8.yaml --weights yolov8.pth --epochs 50
```

- `--data`: Path to the dataset configuration file.
- `--cfg`: Path to the YOLOv8 configuration file.
- `--weights`: Path to pre-trained weights (optional).
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.

## Usage

To use the trained model for inference, run the following command within the `avocado_detection.ipynb` notebook:

```python
!python detect.py --weights best.pt --source avo_image.png
```

- `--weights`: Path to the trained model weights.
- `--source`: Path to the input image or video.

The detected objects will be shown with bounding boxes and labels.
